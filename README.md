# I'm Karro 
#### A marketing professional turned front end developer looking for work out of Stockholm (Sweden) or remotely. I like to say that I build clean, beautiful user interfaces that speak to its visitors in the language of my clients and their visions for the brand.

## The Projects
Most of my projects are built using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). My projects where all created with the test driven development method where the two primary testing frameworks are [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [RSpec](https://rspec.info/).
